The GitHub History of the Scala Language

This project is an analysis of the GitHub history of the Scala programming language. It explores the development of Scala over time by analyzing its GitHub repository and visualizing the data using various charts and graphs.

Data Source
The data for this project was collected from the GitHub API using the requests library in Python. The data includes information on pull requests, issues, commits, contributors, and more.

Data Analysis
The data was cleaned and processed using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy. The processed data was then used to create various visualizations using tools such as matplotlib and seaborn. The visualizations include line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, and more, and are used to explore various aspects of the Scala language's development over time.

Results
The results of the analysis show how Scala has evolved over time in terms of contributors, pull requests, issues, and more. The visualizations provide insights into patterns and trends that have emerged over time, such as spikes in pull requests around major releases, or changes in the composition of the contributor base.

Usage
To reproduce the analysis, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

requests
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
Once you have installed these libraries, you can run the analysis by running the scala_history.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
